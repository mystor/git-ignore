# git-ignore

A very simple script. Type `git-ignore Python` to download the standard Python `.gitignore` file from github. Downloads scripts from https://github.com/github/gitignore.

Doesn't handle the symlinked Gitignores from the repo very well (like `Clojure` and `Fortran`), but will download most of the other ones.
